# product range analysis project

in this project we are tasked to preform a product range analysis on data that contains the transaction history of an online store that sells household goods.

the project has several files:
- the final project - product range analysis.ipynb - jupyter notebook of the entire project
- Product range analysis.pdf - presentation of the key elements of the project.

there is also a Tableau dashboard:
(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yael.soosan/viz/productrangeanalysisbydatepurchasesandreturns/productrangeanalysisdashboard?publish=yes)

remark:
due to size limitations :
1. there is no cvs copy of the data frame.
2. the histogram featured in this note book was created using matplotlib, but originaly created in plotly express (a copy of the original plotly code is left in a mark down cell)
